 * prove that they carry a valid policy. For a detailed summary of the insurance
 * policy protocol, please see doc.go

 * To create a policy:

 *		ListOfInsurrers, OptionalMethodOfChoosingInsurers, GroupForPrivateShares,
 *		MinimumNumberOfPrivateSharesNeededForReconstruction, TotalNumberOfShares)

 * created along with an updated status in ok.
